# Welcome to MKTimer
MKTimer is an application for tracking your Mario Kart Time Trials.   
It is currently in a very very early build with various knwon issues, just a few implemented features and a simple UI.
As of now, you can only select Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tracks (with DLC) (but only those with 3 laps, sorry Baby Park).

### How to run the application
This is a .NET Core Form + Console Application, which you can run with pretty much any IDE that supports this tech stack. Maybe I will add a `.exe` in the future for easier usage.

### How to contribute
As for now, I don't think anyone is interested in this, and if so, please add some Issues to the Issue List and tell me about bugs, feature requests and more. Feel free to contact me here in GitHub or via mail.

### What's planned
If I'm going to continue using this application, I want to build more and better features and fix all the known issues. Some ideas for the near future are
* MKLeaderboards integration (maybe submitting runs, fetching leaderboards and WRs)
* Adding own comparisons to you sheet
* Customization of the UI

Thanks for reading this.
